Today we chose to enhance  reporting capabilities for the Federal Dashboard on Sustainable Purchasing. Using data captured in the government wide procurement system. This includes slicing and dicing the data by various factor such as product/service, total dollars, number of contracts, by quarter/fiscal year, etc. to show where agencies are putting their dollars toward environmentally sustainable products and services.

#Process
In Order to deliver a working product, Team chose to follow Agile Process. 
After the Team got familiar with the challenge topics presented at the beggining of Hackathon, Team met for a quick planning meeting, were it was decided to divide the work into 3 Sprints.
Here is the schedule for each Sprint:
