Today we chose to enhance  reporting capabilities for the Federal Dashboard on Sustainable Purchasing. Using data captured in the government wide procurement system. This includes slicing and dicing the data by various factor such as product/service, total dollars, number of contracts, by quarter/fiscal year, etc. to show where agencies are putting their dollars toward environmentally sustainable products and services.

#Process
In Order to deliver a working product, Team chose to follow Agile Process. 
After getting familiar with the challenge topics presented at the beggining of Hackathon, Team met for a quick planning meeting and committed into 4 major user stories, which were divided into 23 tasks.
Team identified 1 Stretch Story to find data connections across publictly available federal governmnet datasets and come up with new ideas that would help agency to manage other areas.
Team decided to divide the work into 3 Sprints, and each of them ended up with the Review.
